/**
 * This is the main class of ZooKeeper client library. To use a ZooKeeper
 * service, an application must first instantiate an object of ZooKeeper class.
 * All the iterations will be done by calling the methods of ZooKeeper class.
 * The methods of this class are thread-safe unless otherwise noted.
 * <p>
 * Once a connection to a server is established, a session ID is assigned to the
 * client. The client will send heart beats to the server periodically to keep
 * the session valid.
 * <p>
 * The application can call ZooKeeper APIs through a client as long as the
 * session ID of the client remains valid.
 * <p>
 * If for some reason, the client fails to send heart beats to the server for a
 * prolonged period of time (exceeding the sessionTimeout value, for instance),
 * the server will expire the session, and the session ID will become invalid.
 * The client object will no longer be usable. To make ZooKeeper API calls, the
 * application must create a new client object.
 * <p>
 * If the ZooKeeper server the client currently connects to fails or otherwise
 * does not respond, the client will automatically try to connect to another
 * server before its session ID expires. If successful, the application can
 * continue to use the client.
 * <p>
 * The ZooKeeper API methods are either synchronous or asynchronous. Synchronous
 * methods blocks until the server has responded. Asynchronous methods just queue
 * the request for sending and return immediately. They take a callback object that
 * will be executed either on successful execution of the request or on error with
 * an appropriate return code (rc) indicating the error.
 * <p>
 * Some successful ZooKeeper API calls can leave watches on the "data nodes" in
 * the ZooKeeper server. Other successful ZooKeeper API calls can trigger those
 * watches. Once a watch is triggered, an event will be delivered to the client
 * which left the watch at the first place. Each watch can be triggered only
 * once. Thus, up to one event will be delivered to a client for every watch it
 * leaves.
 * <p>
 * A client needs an object of a class implementing Watcher interface for
 * processing the events delivered to the client.
 *
 * When a client drops the current connection and re-connects to a server, all the
 * existing watches are considered as being triggered but the undelivered events
 * are lost. To emulate this, the client will generate a special event to tell
 * the event handler a connection has been dropped. This special event has
 * EventType None and KeeperState Disconnected.
